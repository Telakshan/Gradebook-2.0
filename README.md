Check out the site [Here!](https://www.gradebook-web.com/) (Currently down due to heroku removing their free tier)

### Uses TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Nodejs, Postgres, Redis. 

### Website where anyone can post messages and vote on said messages. 

### Authentication is secured by HTTP Cookie.

### Has a dark mode that persists even after browser is closed. I've achieved this by using React Context API.
